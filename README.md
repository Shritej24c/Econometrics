# Panel Data Study: Determinants of Life Expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)

**What is Life Expectancy?** 

Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing
patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life

Below image clearly shows the disparity in Life Expectancy across different countries in 2019

Life expectancy has burgeoned since the advent of industrialization in the early 1900s and the world
average has now more than doubled to 70 years. Yet, we still see inequality in life
expectancy across and within countries. In 2020, Monaco sits at the top with the highest life expectancy at 86 years whereas some countries in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region, for example, the Central African Republic, have a life expectancy of 54.6 years


Following plot shows how Life Expectancy has changed from 1950 - 2021 for some high GDP/capita countries compared to Central African countries:

There's a drastic difference in Life Expectancy
